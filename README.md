## Description
* A Info Gaming website where users can search for their favorite games and get to know more information about the game such as the game summary, videos, screenshots, etc. Users also have an opportunity to create an account and bookmark/favorite their favorite game in which can later be removed from their account. 

## How does it Works?

###### Homepage
*  When the users first head to the site, the homepage will explain what does the site do. As users scroll, it will show a carousel of games that are currently popular, recently released, and games that are coming soon.

</p>

###### Searching
* In the search bar, users can search for their favorite games. As for the example below, let say you want to search for a game called "God Eater".

* Sometimes users may misspelled something or type a bunch of gibberish. A no results page is incorporated to fix those types of habits as shown below.
